In the controller window:
   Run the controller in a new window with: 
   ryu-manager --verbose /home/mininet/flowcontrol.py --observe-links
	
   or in general:
   ryu-manager --verbose (path to the flowcontrol.py file) --observer-links 

   You can add a -x flag at the end of this command to open up terminals for each node in the network 

In the second window:
   Our topology is in the topo.py file and can be called from the command line with mytopo
      Running the topology in mininet with:
      sudo mn --custom topo.py --topo mytopo --controller remote --link tc -x

   Once both the controller and the mininet topology is up and running, you can ping h1 to h2
      Note: You may have to ping one of the switches first inorder to connect properly to h2
      h1 ping -c 3 h2 		this command will send 3 ping request to h2's ip address
      

Check TCP connection over HTTP server 
   h1 python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 &
   h2 wget -O - h1

Check TCP connection using iperf command 
   From h1:


      iperf -s -u -i 1 -p 6585
   From h2:


      iperf -c 10.0.0.1 -p 6585-u -b 1M
